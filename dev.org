* Main plans
The high level point of this project is to provide hosted decktape conversions.
That is, you give the site a URL and it converts the URL to a PDF using
decktape. For a lot or purposes, this will be simpler that forcing users to
install decktape...though, notably, it introduces the complexity that the URL
must be reachable from decktape.io (i.e. it can't be locally hosted).

Here are the parts I envision right now:

- Elm frontend that lets the user enter the URL and any processing options
- A Pyramid server that accepts the requests and launches conversions
- Initially we'll probably just do conversion in the pyramid process.
  Ultimately, though, we'll probably want something like celery to let us farm
  the work out to other processes/machines. A task queue will also make it
  easier to manage resource usage if the service becomes popular enough for that
  to be an issue. It's probably a bit easier to test/verify, too.
- Results will be stored in mongodb (or some other document database). The
  filesystem might be a reasonable option as well, but a database feels simpler
  in this case. It will allow us to more easily associated metadata with
  results, I think. We'll see.
- (bonus points) It might be worthwhile adding google adwords or something to
  the site to generate a bit of income. It would be an interesting experiment if
  nothing else.

I'll probably continue to use this document to keep track of development, in
conjunction with an online issue tracker.
